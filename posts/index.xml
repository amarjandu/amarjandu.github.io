This is true for most types of engineering, my observations has been with race-cars, and software.
The RSX always had a check engine light for a gas-cap leak (fixed with a new seal), but I failed address the issue right away. Had I addressed the issue, I would have known that I was also throwing codes on the racetrack for a VTEC solenoid (oil probably), and a knock sensor failure (bye-bye motor), when I was on the race track.</description></item><item><title>Side Tracked</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/s30/side-tracked/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 09:47:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/s30/side-tracked/</guid><description>Side Tracked? Look-look-look, I just got a little side tracked with the side yard. There are still things that need to get shuffled around. But I had a terrible idea while out there the other night.
Fixating on the jacks for some reason, I decided right then and there that they were going to have to be lifted off the ground. So we looked online, and decided $89 was too much for a product like this, and that we could design one ourselves.</description></item><item><title>preparations</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/s30/preparations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:48:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/s30/preparations/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Preparations&amp;rdquo;, or how I cleaned the garage I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for several days on cleaning the garage in effort to make a revitalize the work space for restoration work. This includes cleaning the attic for part organization/storage, building new shelves in the shed (more parts storage), and reorganizing boxes on the shop floor.
Organization is not only for my mental sanity, its also a political move to keep everyone happy. If we were working in a mess, there would be additional &amp;ldquo;conversations&amp;rdquo; to be had about how the place is upside-down.</description></item><item><title>doctests</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/doctests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 18:48:23 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/doctests/</guid><description>Consider some small function such as:
def parse_string(input: str): try: name, value = input.split(&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;) except ValueError: name = input value = None assert name, input return name, value These utility functions typically have a small footprint, yet there can be dozens of them scattered in a codebase. Testing them directly within the test suite can be done, but if you start adding multiple files for multiple utility functions, the disassociation between proximity of definition and location of tests make it annoying to maintain.</description></item><item><title>Deliberate</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/deliberate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:43:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/deliberate/</guid><description>Just a reminder to be intentional with time and deliberate in action.</description></item></channel></rss>
