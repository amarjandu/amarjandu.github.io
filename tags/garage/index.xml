We pulled this apart so we can install a Cusco LSD into the unit. While this is removed I intend to replace whatever is ruined.
Before pulling this out, I had noticed some notchyness when shifting between 1st-&amp;gt;2nd, as well as the 3rd gear popping out of gear when on track.</description></item></channel></rss>
