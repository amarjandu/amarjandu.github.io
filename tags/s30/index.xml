I&amp;rsquo;m sure this rotted out due to a poor decision from the factory of filling in weep hole with body filler or panel glue. On the side that was not completely disintegrated there was a bunch of goop in the corner in between the panels.
I regret starting with such a complex panel as the first one. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to remake the panel a few times before getting it &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Fixtures and Jigs</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/fixtures-and-jigs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 21:53:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/fixtures-and-jigs/</guid><description>After getting a better look at the chassis I realized that putting it onto a rotisserie would be a bad idea. The issue is the flex in the chassis, there is no way to guarantee that the chassis will not flex and move as as I cut out large section of the firewall and rockers.
So I decided to make a jig that bolts into some primary locations on th chassis and allows for some adjustment to ensure that everything is level.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Start</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/a-fast-start/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 17:59:44 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/a-fast-start/</guid><description>I started working on the white chassis. As the car sits in front of me I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled apart the: suspension (front and rear), interior dash, and interior sound deadening. Sound deadening took around 4 hours of chiselling while using dry ice to harden the old tar mat.
Most of the rust damage to the car is isolated to the battery tray. Probably due to battery acid eating the paint, then road salt and water damage over the years.</description></item><item><title>Side Tracked</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/side-tracked/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 09:47:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/side-tracked/</guid><description>Side Tracked? Look-look-look, I just got a little side tracked with the side yard. There are still things that need to get shuffled around. But I had a terrible idea while out there the other night.
Fixating on the jacks for some reason, I decided right then and there that they were going to have to be lifted off the ground. So we looked online, and decided $89 was too much for a product like this, and that we could design one ourselves.</description></item><item><title>preparations</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/preparations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:48:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/preparations/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Preparations&amp;rdquo;, or how I cleaned the garage I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for several days on cleaning the garage in effort to make a revitalize the work space for restoration work. This includes cleaning the attic for part organization/storage, building new shelves in the shed (more parts storage), and reorganizing boxes on the shop floor.
Organization is not only for my mental sanity, its also a political move to keep everyone happy. If we were working in a mess, there would be additional &amp;ldquo;conversations&amp;rdquo; to be had about how the place is upside-down.</description></item><item><title>how to make a cut</title><link>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/how-to-make-a-cut/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amarjandu.github.io/posts/how-to-make-a-cut/</guid><description>Sometimes you have to be technical with how you approach your cut, going in with your saw blazing mates it difficult to put things back together.

My approach has been the following;
Clean back as much as possible to expose how the joints are formed. Make a mental model of what I need to replace (there is a lot in this case) Drill reassembly holes for Cleo fasteners Remove spot welds (punch, drill, spot weld cutter) Remove panels I ended up exposing the large section that I need to remove.</description></item></channel></rss>
