My approach has been the following;
Clean back as much as possible to expose how the joints are formed. Make a mental model of what I need to replace (there is a lot in this case) Drill reassembly holes for Cleo fasteners Remove spot welds (punch, drill, spot weld cutter) Remove panels I ended up exposing the large section that I need to remove.</description></item></channel></rss>
