It took a long time, but I finally got that motorcycle running. Interestingly it 
was always able to run, I was just operating the carburetor's choke incorrectly.
There is something about that motorcycle that makes me want to stop working on it.
When I got it 10 years ago, it was the fact that all the aluminum and steel fasteners had some level of galvanic corrosion on them, leading to snapped fasteners, and a frustration.

But this bike has been a mixed beast, the other issue is that JIS philips heads are different, from PH2 heads, causing the soft-rusty metal to shear when you try to apply any force on it. What's the alternative, most people suggest "to install hex fasteners and never be bothered", which will work, but a better approach would have been, get a JIS Impact head and use a impact driver to remove them... Sorry I digress, what was this about? Oh yeah, mental blockers. 

The carb issue was in-fact an issue with dealing with non-stop frustrations with the bike.
Here is a machine thats so loud, and dangerous that it can only be worked on for certain times of the day, mix that in with not knowing how to approach an issue, and juggling life; you'll end up with a project that sits for extended periods of time. These are mental blockers that the past experiences of me has installed in order to divert attention to other things.

2022 felt like the year of trying to wield these mental blockers and understand how to get around them.
