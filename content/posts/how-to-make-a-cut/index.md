Sometimes you have to be technical with how you approach your cut, going in with your saw blazing mates it difficult to put things back together.

My approach has been the following;

1. Clean back as much as possible to expose how the joints are formed.
2. Make a mental model of what I need to replace (there is a lot in this case)
3. Drill reassembly holes for Cleo fasteners
4. Remove spot welds (punch, drill, spot weld cutter)
5. Remove panels

I ended up exposing the large section that I need to remove.

there are three segments to replace here: the firewall panel, the battery panel, and the lower front frame rail. The firewall panel must be the first one to be replaced as it sets the base for the frame rail, which then is used to align the battery tray.

The order is a bit like a stack, first in last out...

Remember when cutting, try to save sections so that you can reconstruct as much as possible.

Don't be too scared! Things that humans have made can be fixed.
