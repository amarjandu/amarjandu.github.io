At the end of our Programming Language course [Professor DujimoviÄ‡](http://sutro.sfsu.edu/People/jozo/jozo.html) (Jozo)
expressed a pleasure of programming with Ruby. At the time I don't think that I fully understood what he meant by that 
statement, after about 4 years I'm finally going back to programming in Java and I think I can relate to what he was
talking about. Java is not really the most user-friendly language when it comes to rapidly expressing an idea out. 

With higher level languages there is a low barrier in trying to express what you are thinking clearly. Being able to 
rapidly express your ideas into a workable program is quite enjoyable.
