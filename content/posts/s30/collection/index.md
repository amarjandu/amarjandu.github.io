When you have an IRL hobby you end up collecting stuff. For me this ends up 
looking like a bunch of tools around the shed and in the garage. My philosophy 
about the physical workspace has changed in the past couple of weeks. While I 
was getting ![side-tracked]({{ ref "/posts/s30/side-tracked" }}) I started to 
think about the physical spaces that I use has having a "real estate cost".

This meant that things that occupy space in the workshop need to be able to 
justify their existence in that space through the cost that it takes to keep it 
there. When I work in the garage there are things that are present that can't
justify their cost. For example there is a motor that sits under the work bench 
in the garage, it cant possibly justify it's existence of taking PRIME space. 

I don't think I actually considered the "cost" of where stuff ends up. It 
certainly has made it easier to throw stuff away. I've cleared out years of stuff
from the side of the garage; an old safe, the suspension setup, half a drive train. 
All gone. I don't feel that bad about getting rid of this stuff either, once the 
decision has been made that it cannot stay, it's tossed or moved to a less 
expensive area.
